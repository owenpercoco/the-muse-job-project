# the-muse-job-project
This is the take home, full stack application for The Muse.


in order to run:
clone into your home location

set up the back end like a normal django project, 
make and run the migrations, and then run the server with 'python manage.py runserver'
it should serve on localhost:8000

then, run the new command 'initializer', this pulls from your api to organize some data for the database

after that, use yarn to start the front end.  It should serve on localhost:3000

Enjoy! I had a nice time figuring this out and am awaiting your response.
